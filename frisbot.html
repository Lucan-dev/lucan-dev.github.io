        <h2>About the Game</h2>

        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>There are 60 Discs and 4 Rollers on a VRC Spin Up Field. Discs can be Scored in the two High Goals, one per Alliance, at opposite corners of the field. Each Disc scored in a High Goal is worth 5 points. However, underneath each High Goal, is a 1-point Low Goal for the opposing Alliance.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to Discs, robots can also spin the four Rollers mounted to the field perimeter. If the area inside of a Roller's pointers only shows one color, that is considered “owned” by that Alliance. Each Owned Roller is worth 10 points.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the end of the match, alliances will receive a 3 point bonus for each Tile their robots are covering.</p>
