        <p>This folding wooden stool is a versatile and convenient piece of furniture that can be used for various purposes. The blend of light and dark brown wood creates a beautiful look. Because of it's foldable design, accurate measuring, marking, and cutting is imperative. To make the joints, I used a drill press to create holes in the wood, inserted wooden dowels inside, and secured it together usign nails. The stool can fold and store easily. It's a simple but functional furniture that serves as a seat or a side table. I enjoyed making this stool and I'm pleased with the result.</p>

        </div>
        <p>This wooden snowman is a delightful and festive ornament that showcases the skill of woodturning. The snowman was carved from a single block of wood using a lathe, to create the body, head, and hat. The snowman has no facial features or accessories, but its simple design gives it a minimalistic and cozy appeal. The snowman was a Christmas gift for my younger sister, who loves it dearly. The overall vibe of this project is one of warmth and joy, as the snowman evokes the spirit of winter and holidays.</p>

        </div>
        <p>This wooden BBQ caddy is a practical and convenient accessory for outdoor grilling. The handle was the most challenging part of the construction process. The outline was first drawn onto a piece of wood and then cut using a bandsaw. The caddy is designed to hold utensils, condiments, and tupperware. It's a simple yet useful accessory that can be used as both a storage and serving tray.</p>

        <div class="color_background">
            <img class="photo" src="./img/Table.jpg" alt="Table">
        </div>
        <p>This coffee table is a textured piece of furniture designed to be used daily. The square top is spacious enough to hold a lamp, a book, a cup of coffee, or any other item that you might need. The lower shelf is also useful for storing magazines, newspapers, or other things that you want to keep handy. The top was made of three pieces of wood glued together, which posed a challenge to make it flat. I applied several coats of varnish and wax to give it a nice shine. This coffee table is a versatile and practical piece of furniture for any homee.
